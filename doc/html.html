<h1>HTML Generation</h1>

<p> We have functions that turn sexps into HTML.  The format of the
sexp is
<pre>
((element-name {:attribute-name attribute-value}*) {contents})
</pre>
where element-name is a symbol, attribute-name is a keyword, and
contents are more elements, or strings.  If there are no attributes,
the parens around element-name can be omitted.  For example
<pre>
(html
 (head (title "Title"))
 (body (p "Click here to visit ((a :href "http://www.google.com/") "Google"))))
</pre>

<p> The functions are HTML (returns a string) and HTML-STREAM (outputs
directly to a stream).  The latter is much less consy, so to be
preferred

<p> We also have a pattern-based rewriting system so that you can
"invent your own tags" (sic), using DEFINE-PATTERNS.  See example 6 in
<a href="../examples/main.lisp">../examples/main.lisp</a>.  This is
used in the DEFINE-PAGE macro, which also gives you correct handling of
conditional GETs for free.
